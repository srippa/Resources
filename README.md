## <a id='SRC'></a>Source control
* I use [Git](http://git-scm.com/). Get started by browsing the [documentations](http://git-scm.com/doc). Also take a look at the [Curated Git links (2014)](http://thelinell.com/2014/12/23/curated-git-links-of-2014/) containing many pointers to useful resources. In particular I recommend to start by the  [how does Git work?](http://thelinell.com/2014/03/19/git/) post.
* I use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to store my pubic repositories.

##  <a id='LA'></a> Numerical linear algebra
Linear algebra is a central infrastructure driving scientific computation in general and more specifically data science and machine learning solutions. 

### Books
  * [Introduction to Linear Algebra](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0980232716?tag=inspiredalgor-20) by Gilbert Strang.
  * [Matrix Computation](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421407949?tag=inspiredalgor-20) by Gene Golub and Charles Van Loan.

### Courses and Videos
  * [Video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/).

### Software
  * [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/)/[LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) are the de facto standards for the language of numerical linear algebra. The libraries are written in FORTRAN but can be linked with any high level language
  * C++
    * [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
    * [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/)
  * Python
    * The main data structure for n-dimensional arrays is given by [numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/), more specific linera algebra procedures are in the [linear algebra module](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.linalg.html)

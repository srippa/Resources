## <a href="#SRC"></a>Source control
* [Curated Git links (2014)](http://thelinell.com/2014/12/23/curated-git-links-of-2014/) containing many pointers to useful resources. In particular I recommend to start by reading [the introductory post](http://thelinell.com/2014/03/19/git/) entitlesd **how does Git work**
* I use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to store my pubic repositories.

## <a href="#SRC">Numerical linear algebra</a> 
Linear algebra is a central infrastructure driving scientific computation in general and more specifically data science and machine learning solutions. 

### Books
  * [Introduction to Linear Algebra](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0980232716?tag=inspiredalgor-20) by Gilbert Strang.
